Once you love the sport and you are dedicated and disciplined, you can achieve anything you want. I was never a good athlete. Growing up, I worked hard. I stayed dedicated and disciplined. Discipline is the biggest thing for every athlete, no matter how good you are, you have to be disciplined and you have to be hungry for what you want. Hard work never loses yet, that's my motto. You got to work hard, put in extra work and you will see the results.” (oecs.org)","Half-brother Kurt Felix (athletics), two-time world championships decathlon finalist (2015, 2017), 2015 Pan American Games silver medallist, 2014 Commonwealth Games bronze medallist",,,2024-08-03,Bronze Medal,3.0,VICTOR Lindon,Male,GRN,Grenada,Grenada,GRN,Grenada,Grenada,,,Athletics,Men's Decathlon,ATH,/en/paris-2024/results/athletics/men-s-decathlon/1500--------,1993-02-28,1573388,,True,athletics,Athletics,ATH,https://olympics.com/en/paris-2024/sports/athletics,Bronze Medal,3.0,2024-08-03,Lindon VICTOR,M,Athletics,ATH,/en/paris-2024/results/athletics/men-s-decathlon/1500--------,GRN,Grenada,Grenada,Grenada,Grenada,0,0,2,2
